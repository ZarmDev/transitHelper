# Note
Some train lines and routes may be inaccurate because it does not consider:
1. Late night service
2. Other service changes reflected in service alerts or planned work
3. According to AI, "Historical Data: Sometimes, GTFS data can include historical or planned future routes that might not be currently active. This could lead to discrepancies between real-time data (like the MTA app) and static data (like your GTFS files)."
