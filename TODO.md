- Filter service alerts for planned work that is happening within this time
- For getArrivals make it so you can just supply an array for line because that's probably better for performance, as running the function in a for loop is bad and will read the same txt files multiple times (also change the parameter name to lines)

- Work on:
getRouteTo
getAllStopCoordinates
getTransfers
getLocationsOfVehicles
getAllData
