In the react-native project, download google_transit every year

Service alerts doesn't include service changes, only delays

Cache the object from stops.txt in react-native

Maybe make a function that maps each stopID in stops.txt to a train
line based on shapes.txt and run it every year...?
And use this data to render everything?
