- Filter service alerts for planned work that is happening within this time
- For getArrivals make it so you can just supply an array for line because that's probably better for performance, as running the function in a for loop is bad and will read the same txt files multiple times (also change the parameter name to lines)
- Do we need to build index.ts anymore? Idk... (regardless it works lol)
