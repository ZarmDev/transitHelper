- Filter service alerts for planned work that is happening within this time
- For getArrivals make it so you can just supply an array for line because that's probably better for performance, as running the function in a for loop is bad and will read the same txt files multiple times (also change the parameter name to lines)
- **MAKE A FUNCTION THAT MAPS EACH STOP_ID TO A TRAIN LINE USING STOPS.TXT AND TRIPS.TXT/ROUTES.TXT
JUST RUN IT ONE TIME AND SAVE IT TO A FILE TO USE IN THE TS FILE**
